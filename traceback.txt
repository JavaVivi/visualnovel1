I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/scripts/chapter1.rpy", line 12, in script
    ro "I am finally back from university. My bag is so heavy. I always have to carry a lot of books. "
  File "renpy/common/000window.rpy", line 114, in _window_auto_callback
    _window_show(auto=True)
  File "renpy/common/000window.rpy", line 69, in _window_show
    renpy.with_statement(trans)
IOError: Couldn't find file 'lab.ogg'.
